      controllers turned on and sitting inside them, rotated so that the internal posts are nudged up against the controller. Only one way they can sit.
      You will need to add left and right controllers as children of Cameraoffset in XRrig, and add tracked posedriver to them. Or if using another Vr sdk, there should be a camera parent, and two controller positions. 
      
      Place reasonable distance apart, but will probably both need to be in view of the headset.
      There is a 10 second delay to allow both controllers to be on and tracked by the headset.
